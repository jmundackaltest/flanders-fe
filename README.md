# Flanders Frontend Coding Challenge - Elegant Login Page Solution

Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jose Thankachan Mundackal, and I've crafted a delightful login page solution for you.

## Developer Details

- **Name:** Jose Thankachan Mundackal
- **Email:** josetm94mec@gmail.com

## Challenge Overview

### 1. Credentials

- **Username:** MAINT
- **Password:** safetyiskey

### 2. Simulated API Call

To mimic real-world scenarios, I've simulated the API call using the `setTimeout` function, with response intervals ranging between 100ms and 600ms.

### 3. Chosen Frontend Framework

For this challenge, I opted for React, bringing the power of TypeScript to ensure a robust and type-safe solution.

### 4. Screenshot

I've incorporated the color #95bce2 and requested imageseamlessly into the layout. Additionally, I've integrated the company logo and favicon that I got from the official link - https://www.flandersinc.com/.
